# HW-SoftMoA
This project introduces a weak-label–guided, soft multi-agent (WL-MoA) framework for flood water-level forecasting that adaptively gates and fuses multiple CNN specialists to improve multi-horizon accuracy—especially on rare flood peaks—while providing macro- and local-level interpretability via agent profiling and Grad-CAM.
